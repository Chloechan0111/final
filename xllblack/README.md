# Final Exam

In this final exam you will compare the Black model lognormal payoff to a Gamma payoff.
The deliverable is an add-in, documentation of the functions you write, and a spreadsheet demonstrating the implied volatilty curve.



You will find the implied volatility curve of the Gamma distribution with a and b parameterized by f and s.

Fork https://github.com/GR6250-2019/final.git to your github repository.
Clone a local copy.
Make sure the build is working.
Implement the value of a put option in fms_gamma.h.
Create and document the add-in in xll_gamma.cpp.
Fill in the final.xlsx spreadsheet.

Use existing code to compute the Black implied volatility.

Generate documentation using Sandcastle Help File Builder.

In this final exam you will compare the Black model lognormal payoff to a Gamma payoff.
The deliverable is an add-in, documentation of the functions you write, and a spreadsheet demonstrating the implied volatilty curve.



You will find the implied volatility curve of the Gamma distribution with a and b parameterized by f and s.
